## Introduction

This project aims to perform customer segmentation for an Ecommerce company using various clustering algorithms, including K-means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative clustering. The goal is to divide customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, enabling the company to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain the dataset containing customer purchase history.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, and scaling if necessary.

3. **Clustering Algorithms**:
    - K-means Clustering
    - DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
    - Agglomerative Clustering

4. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of each clustering algorithm using appropriate metrics.

5. **Visualization**: Visualize the clusters to gain insights into customer segments.

6. **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations based on the clusters to improve marketing strategies.

## Data

Describe the dataset you used for this project, including its source, structure, and any data cleaning or preprocessing steps. You can also mention any sample data or data exploration results here.

## Algorithms

### K-means Clustering

K-means is a popular centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data points into K clusters based on their similarity.

### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together data points that are close to each other in high-density areas and considers data points in low-density areas as noise.

### Agglomerative Clustering

Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical clustering technique that starts with individual data points and recursively merges them into clusters based on their similarity.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to run the clustering algorithms and any other relevant code. Include example commands or scripts if applicable.

## Results

Share the results of your clustering analysis, including insights gained from the clusters and any actionable recommendations for the Ecommerce company.
